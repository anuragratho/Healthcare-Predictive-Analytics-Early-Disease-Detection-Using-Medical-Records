# Healthcare-Predictive-Analytics-Early-Disease-Detection-Using-Medical-Records

# Project Objectives
These were the four subsystemic goals of this research project with an overreaching aim of promoting distributed computing in healthcare analytics. The primary technical goal was to develop a big data pipeline using MapReduce paradigm of Hadoop and fine-tune them to suit characteristic of medical data ingestion, computation and storage. Based on such foundation, the project achieved further clinical goals of establishing methods of analytical nature to estimate frequencies of symptoms and analyze possible trends in patient manifestations with emphasis placed on normalization and statistical verification. The last integration problem was solvedthrough the creation of data pipelines for transfer of data from HDFS storage to MySQL DBs; there was a challenge in mapping the schema as well as the integrity of data between different structures of storage. Last, the project created a version controlled and parameterized structure with clear explanation for all methods used and sufficient documentation to allow for validation for the framework and scales to the larger clinical datasets. To achieve these aims, it included quantifiable results such as processing speed and accuracy, confidence intervals for certain types of clinical data, methods for system integration, and principles of reproducibility â€“ all of which were developed to form a quantifiable approach to analyzing medical data that meets both short term research demands as well as long term requirements in the medical industry.

# Research Questions
The study was focused on the following three research
questions:
1. Technical Implementation: What are the
effective patterns for dividing the medical
record data for analysis using Hadoop
MapReduce design, setting up jobs and
performance enhancing techniques?
2. System Architecture: How should distributed
computing components be architecturally
integrated with traditional database systems
to maintain data consistency while enabling
analytical flexibility?
3. Clinical Insights: What quantitative patterns
emerge from distributed processing of
symptom data, and how do these findings
compare with established medical knowledge
about symptom prevalence?
